### Brandon Evans
Greetings! I am a former student of mathematics and former project manager interested in software development. 
In my next position, I would like to apply principles of mathematics to several areas of computer science, including but not limited to: Algorithmic design, image processing & analysis, machine learning and deep learning. 
#I am currently working on extending the range of applications to my most recent repositories
#I am learning how to code in Golang.
#My current place of work is at the local plasma donation facility, and I enjoy expanding my current coding skill set through boot.dev in my spare time.
#I will be doing write ups of the projects I publish, so be sure to follow https://medium.com/@mathewbevans
#I enjoy a good project and appreciate collaboration. I am looking to collaborate on front-end/back-end projects, as well as any projects that involve algorithm implementation.
